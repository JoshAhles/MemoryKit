# Third-party assets

- **models/BrainUVs.obj** — 3D brain mesh used by the hero brain visualization (`src/js/brainScene.js`). Parsed in a Web Worker; only this file is required.

If you have a leftover empty `third_party/3dbrain` directory (from the previous 3dbrain app), you can remove it with:

```bash
rm -rf third_party/3dbrain
```
